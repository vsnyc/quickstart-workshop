### Deployment options
Each Quick Start should allow users to deploy the workload into an existing VPC or in a new VPC which is created as part of the Quick Start.
Which means, we need to provide two deployment options to cover both the scenarios:

1. Building a new virtual private cloud (VPC) that contains the AWS infrastructure for the workload. This scenario enables users to set up a test, demo, or POC environment that doesn’t interfere with their production environment.
2. Deploying the workload into an existing VPC. This scenario enables quick adoption by users who want to deploy the workload into their existing production environment.

### Modularity

To cover both the above scenarios, we will structure our templates in a modular fashion, as shown below.
![master-template](/images/master-template.png?width=40%&height=40%)

**master.template** is the entry point to deploy the Quick Start into a new VPC. It creates a VPC, a Linux bastion, and the workload, as nested stacks.

**workload.template** is the entry point to deploy the workload into an existing VPC.

When user wants to deploy the Quick Start into a new VPC, he will launch **master.template**. And to deploy the Quick Start into an already existing VPC, he will launch **workload.template**. Workload template will require VPC information to be passed in as parameters.

### Build master template
Let's create the master templete now.

Master template will create one or many nested stacks, depending upon the Quick Start architecture. 

For this workshop's Quick Start architecture, master template will create three nested stacks - VPC stack, Linux bastion stack and a workload stack, as shown in the image above.

Create the master template by creating a file called `master.template.yaml`, copy the below contents into the file, and save.

```

Description:
  This template creates the VPC and workload as nested stacks.

Parameters:
  set of parameters

Mappings:
  set of mappings

Conditions:
  set of conditions

Resources:
  set of resources

Outputs:
  set of outputs
```

Right now the **master.template.yaml** is incomplete. It doesn't do much at this point. You will be filling in different sections of the templates as you follow along rest of the workshop.
